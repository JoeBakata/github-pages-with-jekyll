I am learning programming.  I plan on creating some programs to help me DM/GM (dungeon master/game master) for various role playing games (rpg's) that I run.
I run and teach new players how to play Dungeons & Dragons 5E.  I prefer to play Basic, BECMI, or AD&D.
Recently I learned of The Fantasy Trip (TFT) and have been learning to run it.
